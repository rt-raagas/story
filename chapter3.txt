I remember home, and I yearn for the sound of raindrops on the roof--instead, I'm stuck at a mediocre metropolitan flat in the middle floor of the Madison building, with an 83-year-old diabetic above me and a rowdy family-of-ten below. The only drops I hear are those from the inky black tea that my roommate drinks. No sugar, no milk. Just the sickening dark bitterness of the "really good for you" tea leaves that Jesse got from the 7-Eleven on the ground floor.
